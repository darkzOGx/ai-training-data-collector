## 📈 Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario

**Month 1:**
- 50 users × 2 runs each = 100 runs
- Average: 50K tokens per run = 5M total tokens
- Revenue: 5M ÷ 10K × $0.70 = **$350/month**
- Your cut (80%): **$280/month**

**Month 3:**
- 200 users × 3 runs each = 600 runs
- Average: 50K tokens per run = 30M total tokens
- Revenue: 30M ÷ 10K × $0.70 = **$2,100/month**
- Your cut (80%): **$1,680/month**

**Month 6:**
- 500 users × 4 runs each = 2,000 runs
- Average: 75K tokens per run = 150M total tokens
- Revenue: 150M ÷ 10K × $0.70 = **$10,500/month**
- Your cut (80%): **$8,400/month**

### Optimistic Scenario (With Marketing)

**Month 6:**
- 1,000 users × 5 runs each = 5,000 runs
- Average: 100K tokens per run = 500M total tokens
- Revenue: 500M ÷ 10K × $0.70 = **$35,000/month**
- Your cut (80%): **$28,000/month**

**Annual Revenue (Year 1):** **$336,000**

## 🔄 Volume-Based Pricing Strategy (Future Option)

Consider tiered pricing after you get established:

| Tier | Monthly Usage | Price per 10K Tokens | Discount |
|------|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| **Starter** | 0-1M tokens | $0.70 | None |
| **Growth** | 1M-10M tokens | $0.50 | 29% off |
| **Scale** | 10M-100M tokens | $0.35 | 50% off |
| **Enterprise** | 100M+ tokens | $0.20 | 71% off |

**Why wait:**
- Start simple with flat pricing
- Add tiers once you have 100+ users
- Use data to optimize tier breakpoints
